# Vision

## One-Liner
A macOS-native Pomodoro timer that showcases idiomatic Swift 6, SwiftUI, and SPM best practices.

## North Star
The go-to reference for how to build a minimal, well-crafted macOS menu bar app — clean architecture, strict concurrency, zero dependencies, high test coverage.

## Key Differentiators
- Pure Swift 6 with strict concurrency (no Objective-C, no Xcode project)
- SPM-only build pipeline with manual app bundle assembly
- Observable macro instead of ObservableObject
- Zero external dependencies
- Opinionated simplicity: 25/5/15 hardcoded, no configuration

## Target User
Swift developers looking for a clean reference implementation of a macOS floating window + menu bar app built entirely with SPM.

## Current Focus
Code quality, documentation, and test coverage worthy of a showcase project.
